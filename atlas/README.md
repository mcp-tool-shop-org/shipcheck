# shipcheck: how it works

Mapped at 2026-10-01 from commit 8561c6d by Atlas 1.24.0.

## What this is

10 parts, mostly Markdown (79 files); code in JavaScript (5), CSS (2), TypeScript (2) and Astro (1). Work enters through 5 doors; CI and Release each reach 2 parts, and CI is followed because a pull request goes through it. It publishes to npm. It deploys a site to GitHub Pages. People run shipcheck.

## What changed since 2026-09-30 (9604005)

- CI's pull request trigger no longer names `.github/workflows/**`, `atlas/**`, `bin/**`, `codecov.yml`, `contracts/**`, `dogfood/**`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `site/astro.config.mjs`, `site/package-lock.json`, `site/package.json`, `templates/**` and `test/**`.
- 1 file changed content, across 1 part.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request; on a push to main touching 13 paths; or by hand. Runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/.
2. **Release.** When a release is published; or by hand. Runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/.
4. **repomesh-broadcast.** When a release is published. Checks package.json.
5. **shipcheck** (a command people run). Runs bin/shipcheck.mjs.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs bin/shipcheck.mjs in bin and test/ in test.
2. It runs git.
3. It uploads coverage to Codecov.
4. It sends a dispatch to dogfood-lab/testing-os on main.

## Who reads the results

CI writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Release** runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/, runs git, and publishes to npm.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs site/astro.config.mjs and site/src/, and deploys the site.

**repomesh-broadcast** checks package.json, commits into a clone of mcp-tool-shop-org/repomesh and pushes there, uploads provenance.json and sbom.json to the release, and opens a pull request.

**shipcheck** (a command people run) runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and runs git.

## What breaks what

- **bin** is imported only from tests, by 1 part (test), and sits on the path of 3 doors.
- **test** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits, since the window holds fewer than 30 qualifying commits.

## What no test touches

- **site** is imported by no test.

## Written but never read

No place this map can see is written, so none goes unread.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

Nothing in this repository writes to a tracked place this map can see.

## Hand-authored

People write .claude/, .github/, contracts/, docs/, dogfood/, the repository root and templates/. Nothing in this repository writes to them.

## Where to start

Start at bin/shipcheck.mjs to follow one run of shipcheck end to end. This path follows shipcheck (a command people run) from its entry, since CI runs only tests and scripts that import no code here.

## What this map cannot see

- 2 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- 4 writes and 31 reads go to the directory the command is run in, not to this repository.
- 18 reads go to a path their caller passes, not to this repository.
- 1 read goes to the directory the command is run in or a path its caller passes, not to this repository.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 25 source files reach 10 revisions.
