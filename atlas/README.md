# shipcheck: how it works

Mapped at 2026-09-23 from commit 875a8ae.

## What this is

10 parts. Work enters through 4 doors; the busiest is CI, which reaches 2 parts.

## What changed since the last map

This is the first map.

## What comes in

1. **CI.** On a pull request touching 12 paths; on a push to main touching 12 paths; or by hand. Runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/.
2. **Release.** When a release is published; or by hand. Runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/.
3. **Deploy site to GitHub Pages.** On a push to main touching 2 paths; or by hand. Runs no file this map can see.
4. **repomesh-broadcast.** When a release is published. Runs no file this map can see.

## What happens through CI

1. The workflow runs bin/shipcheck.mjs in bin and test/ in test.
2. It sends a dispatch to dogfood-lab/testing-os.

## Who reads the results

CI writes nothing this map can see.

## The other doors

**Release** runs bin/shipcheck.mjs and test/, and publishes to npm.

**Deploy site to GitHub Pages** runs no file this map can see and deploys the site.

**repomesh-broadcast** runs no file this map can see, commits ledger/events/events.jsonl and pushes, and opens a pull request.

## What breaks what

- **bin** is imported only from tests, by 1 part (test), and sits on the path of 2 doors.
- **test** is imported by no other part and sits on the path of 2 doors.

## What tends to change together

No two source files changed together often enough to name.

Window: 180 days; a pair counts from 3 shared commits.

## What no test touches

- **site** is imported by no test.

## Written but never read

No place this map can see is written, so none goes unread.

## Helpers that look duplicated

No two parts export a helper that looks alike.

## Generated, never hand-edited

Nothing in this repository writes to a tracked place this map can see.

## Hand-authored

People write .claude/, .github/, contracts/, docs/, dogfood/, the repository root and templates/. Nothing in this repository writes to them.

## Where to start

.github/workflows/ci.yml → test/

Read those in order to follow one pull request end to end.

## What this map cannot see

- 1 import site could not be resolved.
- 1 write and 28 reads use paths built at run time and are not named here.
- Statistics confidence is low: fewer than 30 qualifying commits in the window, and fewer than 20 source files reach 10 revisions.

Regenerate with `npx --yes @dogfood-lab/atlas map`.
